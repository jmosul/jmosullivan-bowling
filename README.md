# Bowling Scorecard

## Origins
During the interview process for a BBC Technology Graduate Scheme I was asked to develop a piece of software that would calculate the score of a game 10 pin bowling.

The exact words was to build a "10 Pin Bowling Scorecard". Mistaking this to mean the software should score an ongoing game. This is the Javascript Application I built, with a bit of PHP form submission to show I could do that too.

## The Angular Conversion

Despite going above and beyond the brief Aunty Beeb did not see fit to give me a job :).
But it was within the interview I first heard about AngularJS and its binding features. It seemed very interesting. Now in a new job at DesignMyNight.com I use AngularJS daily and love it.
So, about a year on from the BBC interview I am converting my Two-page Prototype Object Oriented Javascript App to an AngularJS App.
